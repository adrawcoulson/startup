  "description": "The first lesson I was taught as a child was how to share. This valuable lesson followed me into adulthood where I'm still sharing with my family! We share wifi, televisions, online subscriptions, and musical libraries. But _sharing is caring_ loses its ring when you can't log into Netflix because your older brother changed the password to his fantasy football league name. Dont you wish there was a way to generate memorible passwords the entire family could access? Good, because that's where I come in.",
