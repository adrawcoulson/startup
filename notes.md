  - URL(Uniform Resource Locator), formatted as such: <scheme>://<domain name>:<port>/<path>?<parameters>#<anchor>, EX. https://byu.edu:443/cs/260/student?filter=accepted#summary
  - Ports connect devices to internet with help of IP address. Our web services uses port 22, 443, 80. 0-1023 used for general purposes. 1023 + for individual use
  - 20	File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for data transfer

**HTTPS
  - Request: <verb> <url path, parameters, anchor> <version>[<header key: value>]*[<body>]
  - Response: <version> <status code> <status string>[<header key: value>]*[<body>]
  - GET, POST(create), PUT(update), DELETE, OPTIONS(metadata)
  - HTTP headers specify metadata about a request or response
  - Request does not know anything about a previous or future request. Cookies are generated by a server and passed to the client as an HTTP header. The client then caches the cookie and returns it as an HTTP header back to the server on subsequent requests.This allows the server to rem ember things like the language preference of the user
**SOP and CORS
  - Same Origin Policy: only allows Jav
  - aScript to make requests to a domain if it is the same domain that the user is currently viewing
  - Cross Origin Response Sharing:allows the client (e.g. browser) to specify the origin of a request and then let the server respond with what origins are allowed.
  - Using 3rd Party Services: if you want to make requests to a different domain than the one your web application is hosted on, then you need to make sure that domain allows requests as defined by the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header it returns.
***Fetch
  - make HTTP requests from JavaScript
  - The basic usage of fetch takes a URL and returns a promise. The promise then function takes a callback function that is asynchronously called when the requested URL content is obtained. If the returned content is of type application/json you can use the json function on the response object to convert it to a JavaScript object.
