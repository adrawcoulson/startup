**Amazon Web Servics**
- My IP address is 52.22.1.162
- Command to remote shell into my server is ssh -i ~/Downloads/production.pem ubuntu@3.83.118.14
**HTML Beginnings**
  - <a href = "URL"> a is for anchor, href is for hyperlink reference
  - <img scr = "URL.jpg"> to connect images
  - always close HTML line with </repeat of initial command>
**HTML Media**
- HTML youtube videos. Share > Embed > Copy code
- HTML Image. Add file to GitHub, copy image address
**Javascript**
- Coding is weak, can be reassigned types
** Connecting .css
- "" are object {} in.css
** Web Services Notes
  - URL(Uniform Resource Locator), formatted as such: <scheme>://<domain name>:<port>/<path>?<parameters>#<anchor>, EX. https://byu.edu:443/cs/260/student?filter=accepted#summary
  - Ports connect devices to internet with help of IP address. Our web services uses port 22, 443, 80. 0-1023 used for general purposes. 1023 + for individual use
  - 20	File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for data transfer
  - 22	Secure Shell (SSH) for connecting to remote devices
  - 25	Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for sending email
  - 53	Domain Name System (DNS) for looking up IP addresses
  - 80	Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for web requests
  - 110	Post Office Protocol (POP3) for retrieving email
  - 123	Network Time Protocol (NTP) for managing time
  - 161	Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for managing network devices such as routers or printers
  - 194	Internet Relay Chat (IRC) for chatting
  - 443	HTTP Secure (HTTPS) for secure web requests
**HTTPS
  - Request: <verb> <url path, parameters, anchor> <version>[<header key: value>]*[<body>]
  - Response: <version> <status code> <status string>[<header key: value>]*[<body>]
  - GET, POST(create), PUT(update), DELETE, OPTIONS(metadata)
  - HTTP headers specify metadata about a request or response
  - Request does not know anything about a previous or future request. Cookies are generated by a server and passed to the client as an HTTP header. The client then caches the cookie and returns it as an HTTP header back to the server on subsequent requests.This allows the server to rem ember things like the language preference of the user
**SOP and CORS
  - Same Origin Policy: only allows Jav
  - aScript to make requests to a domain if it is the same domain that the user is currently viewing
  - Cross Origin Response Sharing:allows the client (e.g. browser) to specify the origin of a request and then let the server respond with what origins are allowed.
  - Using 3rd Party Services: if you want to make requests to a different domain than the one your web application is hosted on, then you need to make sure that domain allows requests as defined by the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header it returns.
***Fetch
  - make HTTP requests from JavaScript
  - The basic usage of fetch takes a URL and returns a promise. The promise then function takes a callback function that is asynchronously called when the requested URL content is obtained. If the returned content is of type application/json you can use the json function on the response object to convert it to a JavaScript object.


**What ports are used for HTTP, HTTPS, SSH?**
  - HTTP typically uses port 80, HTTPS uses port 443, and SSH uses port 22.
    
**What do HTTP status codes in the 300, 400, 500 range indicate?**
  - 300 range generally indicate redirection, 400 range indicate client errors,  500 range indicate server errors
    
**What does the HTTP header content-type allows you to do?**
  - specify the type of content that is being sent in the body of an HTTP request or response. It tells the recipient how the content is encoded or what the media type is so that the recipient can properly interpret and handle the content.
    
  - For example, if you set Content-Type: application/json in the header, it indicates that the content of the HTTP message body is in JSON format. Similarly, Content-Type: text/html specifies that the content is HTML.

**What do the following attributes of a cookie do? •	Domain •	Path •	SameSite •	HTTPOnly**
  - Domain: Specifies the domain for which the cookie is valid. Cookies are typically sent to the domain they originated from and any subdomains. For example, a cookie set for .example.com would be sent to example.com as well as subdomain.example.com.

  - Path: Defines the URL path for which the cookie is valid. If a cookie is set with a specific path, it will be sent only to that path and its subdirectories. For instance, a cookie set for /products will be sent to URLs like /products/item1, /products/item2, etc.

  - SameSite: This attribute is a relatively newer addition to cookies and is used to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. It defines whether a cookie should be sent with cross-origin requests. SameSite=Strict allows cookies to be sent only in a first-party context (requests initiated by the same site). SameSite=Lax allows some cross-site context, for example, a link clicked from an external site. SameSite=None allows cross-origin sharing, but it requires the Secure attribute (secure context, usually over HTTPS).

  - HttpOnly: When this attribute is set, it prevents the cookie from being accessed by JavaScript. It helps mitigate certain types of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by ensuring that the cookie is only accessible via HTTP(S) requests and not through client-side scripts.

**Assuming the following Express middleware, what would be the console.log output for an HTTP GET request with a URL path of /foo/bar?**
